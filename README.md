Split your writing into different markdown files.  Then, concatinate them with `gulp`.

# getting started

Just open `gulpfile.js` and set `sourceFiles` to the filenames you want to concatinate. Then, `gulp` to compile them.

But be sure you `npm install` first!

The handiest is `gulp watch`, which will compile whenever one of your source files changes.
